\par
website\par
html has 2 main parts\par
1.head:title,connecting all your files using links and scripts\par
links use href="style.css"\par
script use src="main.js"\par
head is the stuff that comes above your website\par
2.body\par
stuff you see in the website\par
\b heading\par
\b0 <h1>,h2,h3,h4,h5..................................................................................\par
h1 is the biggest heading\par
\b paragraph\b0\par
<p> \par
\b picture\par
\b0   <img src="">\par
\b break it works like an enter\b0 <br>\par
its like horizantal line <hr> \par
its above each other\par
div is like a box i)if it is inside the \ul\b same div\ulnone  \b0 it will be one \ul\b beside \ulnone\b0 the other\par
if it is in diffrent divs it will be one below the other\par
<div> one below the other its basically like a box\par
<span> one beside the other\par
<b> bold\par
<i>icon\par
fa fa is use for tiny symbols\par
glyphicon is used for icons\par
sequence=order of steps\par
\par
computer program=when you change algorithm into computer language\par
example=js,css,html\par
\par
algorithm\par
written in human language.\par
it helps us come up with the logic to solve a problem\par
\par
\par
variable is something that can change.\par
at a time it can have only 1 value\par
example moving parts or score\par
\par
array is a list \par
example var fruits=["bannanna","watermelon","apple"];\par
array use index to know which item you r talking about\par
index starts counting from zero\par
\par
function\par
is a group of steps that first need to be defined and once defined  can be executed with a single commmand\par
 defining a function means actually making it\par
calling a function means using the defined function to actualy make it work\par
\par
binary\par
its when a computer understand 2 things\par
example 01,true or false,on and off\par
binary string is a combination between 0s and 1s\par
example 01110000111,101110\par
\par
events and actions\par
event=trigger\par
action=results\par
example if i push you u fall\par
push is the event which is causing the action fall\par
\par
loops happening again and again\par
1.repeat=it needsthe exact number of times its happening\par
2.\b while loop\b0\par
when you dont know the exact number of times\par
but do know a condition when the looop has to happen then use the while looop\par
  \b works only if the condition is true\par
\b0 example while path ahead move forward\par
3.\b until loop\par
works if the condition is false\par
\b0 example until time is up keep playing\par
4.nested loop a loop within a loop\par
5.for loop \par
3 things begnning number,ending,how mmuch you are increasing or decreasing by                                    \par
i++=increasing i by 1\par
i--decreses by 1\par
\b angle to turn=360/number of sides\par
\b0 [to make a symetric close shape example square hexagon nanogon]\par
\par
native app=downlodable and doesnt need a browser like the apps on our phone\par
web app=is not downloadble and needs a browser\par
browser=google chrome,firefox,microsoft edge,safar,bing yahoo,opera,DuckDuckGo.........................\par
navigate to take control to another place\par
column on top of each other\par
row beside each other\par
database is a collection of information that is organized in such a way so it can be easily accesed,manged,updated\par
internal database=its stored inside your device\cf1\par
\cf0 external database=stored outside the device example google drive,i cloud,hard disk,pen drive..................................................................................................................................................\par
realtime database, data is not kept or stored for a long time, but is passed along to the end user as quickly as it is gatherede database\par
\cf1\par
\cf0 api key is the name of the folder\par
database url is the address\cf1\par
\cf0 url=uniform resource locater\par
source=where it comes from\par
normal database stores everything till you delete it and is slower than realtime datbase\par
chatbots=creates a simulation to make it look like your talking to s human but  in reality   it is   robot                                                                                                                                                         \cf2\b\par
\cf0 intent =questions or sentences that user might say \par
response=answer or reply that the computer gives\par
training phases\par
teaching the computer all the questions and answers it has both intent and responses\par
intagration= getting the link to use it somewhere else \par
 small talk=all the common questions and answers\par
 entuy = when you want to select a particular item or name\par
beta features=adding addtional features to test it\par
fallback intent=when the chatbot doesnt reconize the question\par
cloud game a live game that couintinulesy updates\par
HTML\par
\b0 <button onclick="function()">\par
<label>\par
<input>\par
input \par
output\par
ul=unordered list\par
li=list item\par
if\par
\par

ROBLOX STUDIO\par
LUA=SCRIPTING LANGUAGE\par
LUA IS A FAST AND POWERFUL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED TO MAKE GAMES ITS ABETTER THAM C LANGUAGE IS A COMBINATION OF JAVA SCRIPT AND C# AND CAN WORK ON ANY DEVICE LUA PEANS MOON IN PORTUGESE.\par
 SCRIPT=MAKES IT LOOK GOOD\par
\tab GO TO VIEW get EXPLORER AND PROPERTIES \par
EXPLORER HAS A WORK SPACE \par
GO TO MODEL AND GET A PART\par
PART IS A BLOCK WE CAN USE IN OUR CODE TO MAKE PARTS IN THE GAME IT HAS MANY PROPERTIES WORKSPACE IS THE PARENT AND PART IS THE CHILD\par
THAT MEANS PART IS IN THE WORKSPACE\par
\par
PROPERTIES OF A PART \par
its better to have diffrent ids otherwise it only uses the id for one of them\par
anchored means does not move\par
can collide means it can hit each other and push them outttttttttt\par
 lua dont have semicoloens in lua\par
go to server script service and add a sciptr to add coding\par

                                                                     DATA TYPES\par
SOMETHING THAT GIVES INFORMATION TO A COMPUTER\par
ABCDE-CHARACTERS OR CHAR\par
+1-10,-5,0-INTERGERS OR INT\par
1.7,3.628,0.01,1.0-DECIMALS OR FLOAT\par
rafi@1234-string\par
0,1-binary\par
@#$%^_!/-special characters\par
TRUE OR FALSE BOOLEAN\par
====================================================================================================================================================================\par
& &-and\par
||-OR\line ===================================================================================================================================================================\par
\par
1.WHEN YOU WANT TO STORE NAMES\par
LIKE BEN\par
JIM\par
JOHN \par
char player="ben"\par
2..-when you want to store numbers like store int score 10 \par
3.. when your talking about money and want to store them decimals\par
float money=26.8\par
4..when you want to store a combination of alphabet and  numbers or symbals you use-string\par
string password=rafi@123 \par
\par
bit is a small part of a box a "bit" is  the  smallest amount of storage on a compute\par
bits can only - 0 or one\par
1 byte = 8 bits\par
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\par
toggle means on and off or open or close\par
z-index is used for layering\par
high index means it will be the top most layer\par
data target =location that will open when you click it\par
data-toggle="collapse" means when your not clicking on it it will be closed.\par
span class="icon-bar"will make a white line\par
to use bootstrap features we have to give specific class names \par
\par
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\par
anchor tags and iframes \par
iframes are like picture frames that show u diffrent website or news inside the frame\par
it needs a \highlight3 src width and height \par
\highlight0\par
example:::::::::::::::::::\par
<iframe src="flopppa is better than bingus" width="658" height="400"> </iframe>\par
